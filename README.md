# usi-transcript-parser

This program is for parsing any number of USI transcripts and generating reports out of them. Currently the only 'report' it generates is a filtered list of courses in the transripts, however this functionality is planned to be improved further.

Is is currently a work in progress.

@see [https://www.usi.gov.au/transcripts/info-for-students](https://www.usi.gov.au/transcripts/info-for-students) for information on what information is contained within a transcript.

## Goals

- [ ] Generate basic reports based on the target courses.
- [ ] Build an easily executable version of the program that anyone can download and run without a tedious installation process
- [ ] Build a web app through which a user can upload transcripts and then download the raw data.
